## Steps to be followed in order to make valid contributions to this repo üçÄ

**1.** Fork the [StackUp](https://github.com/mrinnnmoy/Stackup) repo by clicking on the fork button on the top of the page. This will create a copy of this repository in your account.

**2.** Clone the forked repository

        git clone "https://github.com/<your-github-username>/Stackup"

- Download and install Node JS v16.16.0
- Download and install Git.
- Go to the terminal of your code editor and run "npm install" to download packages.
- Run "npm run dev" to start a local server.

**3.** Make necessary changes and commit those changes. <br />
Remember never push anything to the Main branch. <br />

Always change your branch to "develop" using:

    git checkout develop

Again check your current branch using:

    git branch

It should point \*develop

Now add your changes using:

    git add files-you-edited

If there are multiple files you can use:

    git add .

Now create a commit message using:

    git commit -m "<commit-message-goes-here>"

    git push origin develop

**5.** Create a Pull Request üëã<br>

Now you go to your repository on GitHub, you‚Äôll see a `Compare & pull request` button. Click on that button and now write a summary of what changes you have done.( Attach images if required). I will review your code and merge it if it passes all the tests.‚ù§Ô∏è
